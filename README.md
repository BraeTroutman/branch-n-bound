# Branch & Bound and Backtracking-- NP Complete Problems

Theory of Algorithms Lesson April 19th 2023

## Goals `5 min`

1. Understand the difference between BnB and Backtracking
2. Identify examples of problems that can be solved with each
3. Define example N/P Complete Prob for BnB solving

## Backtracking `30 min`

Search Problems

1. Example Satisfiability: defining our search space
2. Satisfiability: limiting our search space

## Branch and Bound `40 min`

Optimization Problems

1. Integer Linear Programming
2. 0/1 Knapsack -> ILP: The power of reductions (demo solving knapsack with optimization library)
