# Branch & Bound and Backtracking-- NP Complete Problems

Theory of Algorithms Lesson April 19th 2023

## Goals `5 min`

1. Understand the difference between BnB and Backtracking
2. Identify examples of problems that can be solved with each
3. Define example N/P Complete Prob for BnB solving

## Backtracking

Search Problems

1. Example Satisfiability: conventional solution
2. Satisfiability: how can we prune solutions

## Branch and Bound

Optimization Problems

1. Integer Linear Programming
2. 0/1 Knapsack -> ILP: The power of reductions
